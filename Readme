## 📘 Project Description

**NotionIQ** is an AI-driven education platform that transforms raw study materials — such as class notes, PDFs, and previous year questions — into structured, easy-to-understand content. It automatically generates summarized notes, quizzes, and Q&A sets to help students learn actively and revise efficiently.

By automating the most time-consuming parts of studying, NotionIQ allows learners to focus on comprehension and retention while enabling educators to create personalized learning resources effortlessly.
